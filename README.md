# Data science projects

The projects I am working on that can't fit into the gist format, for now there are:
- A python version of neural network regression model to predict martensite start temperatures in stainless steels
- A k-means clustering and glcm texture analysis for automatic microstructure registration
- A recommender system, built (almost) from scratch

... more to come !
